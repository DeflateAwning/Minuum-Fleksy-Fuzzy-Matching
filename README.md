# Minuum-Fleksy-Fuzzy-Matching
This is a technology demonstration for how to implement a fuzzy words matching like Minuum Or Fleksy input method

## What's this ?
Minuum and Fleksy input method is so cool, and I am interested in how they can do a crazy fuzzy words matching. I do a lot of google search, but can not find the details of the real. The most valuable clues is [http://minuum.com/model-your-users-algorithms-behind-the-minuum-keyboard/](http://minuum.com/model-your-users-algorithms-behind-the-minuum-keyboard/), the `language model` is not very hard for me, but the `spatial model` is a new concept for me. After a long time of learning process, I found the magic for `spatial model` --  [k-nearest neighbors algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) of `Machine Learning`. And I wrote the concept prototype code for `spatial model`

## How to run it ?
Before run it, you should install `numpy` and `sklearn` module for python, and then you can play with it :)
